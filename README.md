# SquirrelSuiter

•	Squirrel Suiter is an endless “flyer” game where you play as a jetpack-equipped flying squirrel, avoiding obstacles and munching acorns to gain the highest score.

•	Squirrel Suiter has multiple levels each with a different theme and each one spawns an infinite number of tiles and obstacles. 
•	My contributions to original project include: physics, UI, level design.

•	Extensions to the game I made myself: ported the game to android, added full controller support, an options menu, and cleaned and organized much of the code.

Original Team: Jared Galloway, Clayton Kilmer, Palmer Hogan, Anisha Malynur, Brett Merrill.
