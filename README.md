# SquirrelSuiter

Squirrel Suiter is an endless “flyer” game where you play as a jetpack-equipped flying squirrel, avoiding obstacles and munching acorns to gain the highest score.

•	Squirrel Suiter has multiple procedurally generated levels each with a different theme. 

• All assets except skyboxes and textures were made by the team.

•	Personal contributions to original project include: physics, UI / Menus, player management, and level design.

•	Extensions to the game: ported the game to Android, added full controller navigation for menus, created an options menu, and refactored the codebase extensively.

Original Team: Jared Galloway, Clayton Kilmer, Palmer Hogan, Anisha Malynur, Brett Merrill.
